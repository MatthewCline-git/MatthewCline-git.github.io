> “I understand there's a guy inside me who wants to lay in bed, smoke weed all day, and watch cartoons and old movies. My whole life is a series of stratagems to avoid, and outwit, that guy.” <br />- Anthony Bourdain

<!-- My own interior indolent operates with such efficiency and poise that I hardly notice him. Left unchecked, this drags me into mindless brain-tickling that vanishes hours of my day. He is the Great Satan, and I am lucky to have just a few consious tricks/heuristics/mind frames to helpt neutralize him. The Shower Problem is one of them. -->

I get home from the gym. Leg day. Knees wobbly, quads halting, calves vacant of all bounce. I enter the front door, immediately sit. I pull out my phone, instinctively, to have a scroll.

Pause.

From here, there is no path to productivity or even meaningful leisure that does not run through a shower. I will do nothing worthwhile while I'm sticky and damp. But I don't want to take a shower. Rather, I don't want to muster the activation energy required to lift myself from my seat.

This is where my interior indolent works his magic. There is one clear answer to the question of what I should do next, but since my primitive lizard-brain wants to conserve energy, <span style="font-family: monospace;">i.i.</span> exempts just hopping in the shower from my perceived list of available options. I.e., I rule the best choice out so certainly that it _ceases to exist_, at least to me. What follows is an agonizing attempt to weight all the other options, each tied for a second place so distant as to be useless.

Shall I unload the dishwasher? That doesn't sound good (because I'm sticky and damp). Maybe it'd a good time to journal (will not, because I'm sticky and damp). I'm free for the next 1.5 hours; I could jump back into my coding project (won't, b/c I'm s + d). How about making those Amazon returns? (ibid).

This cyclical consideration and dismissal of bad options while ignoring the obvious solution is The Shower Problem.

<div class="mermaid">
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    s1: What do I do?
    s2: Clear winner
    
    state "Misery Zone" as MiseryZone {
        s3: Worse option
        s4: Waste more time
    }
    
    s1 --> s2: How about...
    s2 --> s3: I lack agency.<br>What else?
    s3 --> s4: That sucks
    s4 --> s3: Other ideas?
</div>

Once one enters the Misery Zone, they are likely to spend much time there. Symptoms of acute exposure to the MZ are irritability, attention fragmentation, brain fog, and general malaise. Symptoms of prolonged exposure include unaccounted-for hours-long blocks of your day/weekend and the sudden recognition that, despite your ambition and self-image as a hard worker, you haven't actually done much to achieve your goals.

In a year, I spend on the order of 1,000 hours battling The Shower Problem. I haven't beaten it yet, but the best weapon I have against it is asking:

> If I had unlimited energy, what would I do right now?

Twists on this hypothetical may instead marginalize the questioner's fear, distractedness, self-conciousness, self-doubt, etc. For me, lethargy is the biggest inhibitor of my desire to do what I know is good for me, and the person I am without it makes choices I admire.
