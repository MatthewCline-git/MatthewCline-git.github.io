Some writing advice from an excellent teacher

<br>

"I was preparing to embark on a mountaineering expedition and had packed enough supplies for two weeks. Among the supplies was a variety pack of foil-pouched MREs. Their quality was bounded by 'gustatorily assaultive' to the south and 'surprisingly not terrible' to the north.

There exist different philosophies of sequencing these packs, much like the child who contemplates whether to save his plate's best bit for the end or enjoy it right away.

I asked an experienced alpinist friend for guidance. He told me:

'Eat your best food first.'

'Why?'

'Because that way, you're always eating your best food.'"
