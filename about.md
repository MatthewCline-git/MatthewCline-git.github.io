A friend asked me recently "In your words what makes life fun and gratifying?"

My reply: "learning from other people, picking someoneâ€™s brain (cliche as it is), moments of true connection with another person (most often through humor), and teaching/mentoring/sharing what I know with other people"

Every good thing that's ever happened to me has been due to the kindness of another person who stood to gain nothing from helping me out and did it anway. If you think there's some way I can help you, get in touch via LinkedIn.

I grew up in Arkansas and attended Phillips Academy Andover and Yale on full scholarships. Originally focused on politics and debate (was ranked #1 in the US), I pivoted to computer science junior year and went from zero coding experience to a big tech offer in 14 months.

Now I'm in NYC working as a SWE, but my core competencies - building rapport, explaining complex concepts simply, and understanding others' points of view - point toward more customer-facing work.
